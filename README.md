## flight lands here

very very simple landing page for info & whatnot

blog posts are still avail on mirror, photo saves on previous site, all links + updates go here

hoping to add..
- backend (whenever i learn WHAT it is and HOW to use it) for comment section (in chat)
- archived set of articles somewhere in my SSD from 2017
- more ascii art!

my intent was to create something i 1) enjoyed using and 2) enjoyed looking at, so i didn't want to introduce rendering optimizations, etc. still creating random apps and SPAs and algos but for the sake of pleasure, i'm going back to the basics!
