        <h1>dreams fly thick and soft over my head</h1>
        I write like I am drifting beneath the sea. Words come to me as my head breeches the surface, words leave me as bubbles form at my mouth. I collect words and allow them to form a breath, an inhale.
        <br><br>
        I exhale onto the page in succinct points. I surface onto the sand with a great bellow of thoughts, sentences, incoherent milestones. I form the timeline as I ache to stitch each piece together. I open my chest to feel the river flow in between the rocks of these bullet points.
        <br><br>
        When the river flows, it tousles each connector and learns to carve story, by connecting. Water pressures stone so often—when I wake, while I eat, before I sleep—and slowly, story appears. I review, I separate my eyes from my sight, I read, I let go. I have written, yes. But I have crafted.
